Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. All patients with an even patient_id have insurance.

Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance. Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance group.

solution-
SELECT
CASE 
WHEN patient_id % 2 = 1 then "NO"
WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 then "YES"
END
AS has_insurance,
sum(case
when  patient_id % 2 = 1 THEN  10
else  50 
end )
as cost_after_insurance from admissions group by has_insurance ;
